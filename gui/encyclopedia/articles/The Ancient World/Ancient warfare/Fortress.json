    "content":"Fortresses were large, heavily fortified structures, garrisoned by a force of men, and usually well stocked in case of a siege. While fortifications like forts could be constructed around a city, usually a fort was a separate entity, constructed to defend a strategic point, such as a narrow pass or a rich deposit of resources."
