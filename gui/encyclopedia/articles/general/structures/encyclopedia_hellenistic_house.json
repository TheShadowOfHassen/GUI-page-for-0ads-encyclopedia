    "Content":"We have more evidence about houses during the Hellenistic period than the structures in earlier Greek culture, thanks to a handbook written by the Roman architect Vitruvius Pollio. And thanks to the fact that during the Hellenistic period they started building with fired bricks rather than unfired ones.\n\nEvidence shows that houses in the Hellenistic style had a second story. And sometimes a sort of tower, however, this feature was more likely in the countryside. Inside the house walls were usually whitewashed, while the floor was usually just packed earth or paving stones. The houses had windows except they were tiny and built very close to the ceiling.\n\nA Hellenistic household, or oikos, typically held extended family with grandparents, parents, sons, their wives and children, unmarried daughters, and slaves if they were wealthy enough to have them. However, only the most trusted slaves would live in the main house, the rest would be quartered in a separate building, possibly with the animals.\n\nThe houses of the middle and upper classes were built around a central courtyard that led off to the different rooms, such as storerooms, the andrôn, where the man hosted his symposium, and the gynaikôn, or women’s quarters. It is debated whether the gynaikôn was where the women lived or whether it was where they worked and spent their free time. However, there is some literary evidence to support the former.\n\n  "
