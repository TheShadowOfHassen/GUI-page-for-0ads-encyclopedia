    "Content":"Horses were prevalent in ancient Chinese culture and mythology. They symbolized perseverance, resilience, and energy. Horse statues are abundantly found in graves, with the most famous being the “Flying Horse of Gansu”. This particular statue depicts a Ferghana horse, a breed legend said had supernatural strength and beauty. \n\nHorses were fundamental to ancient Chinese society and saw use in many different areas. Stirrups, horse collars, and breast straps are all believed to have been invented in China. Even one of the Han dynasty's nine ministers, the third-highest layer of government, was responsible for the empire's horses: the Minister Coachman. Horses generally were prestige items, though, and very expensive for the average citizen. Besides displaying their wealth, influential Han used them for transportation, either by riding them or having them pull carriages. And because of their high speed, horses were also used for carrying messages across long distances. Equestrian sports like hunting or chariot racing were popular in ancient China as well. The game of polo, for example, dates back to the Han dynasty. And most importantly, of course, horses served as mounts for the military.\n\n  "
