    "Content":"In the Han dynasty, the typical combination of spear and shield was rivaled by other, more advanced weaponry. However, ordinary spearmen were still very common. This was because shields and spears required little effort and expertise to manufacture. And fighting with a shield and spear was easy to learn, which was important because Han armies largely consisted of militia.\n\nAncient Chinese spears were usually 10 to 16 feet long (3 to 5 meters). Like many ancient Chinese weapons, they had leaf-shaped blades sharpened to the edges and towards the top. Ancient Chinese spears were also characterized by their red horsehair tassel. The tassel indicated elite status and is said to have distracted enemies and protected the shaft from blood.\n\nThe distinctive Chinese shield was called “Shuang Hu Dun.” It was usually made of wood covered by lacquered hide. It measured somewhere around 30 inches (75 centimeters) in height and 18 inches (45 centimeters) in width. Its signature mark was its unique shape; the Shuang Hu Dun was almost rectangular, but the edges turned into unique curves. The reason for this peculiar shape remains unknown to this day.\n\n  "
