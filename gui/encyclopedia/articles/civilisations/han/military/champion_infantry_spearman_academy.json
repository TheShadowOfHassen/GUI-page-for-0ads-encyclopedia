    "Content":"The Han empire's capital was protected by various guard corps. The largest and strategically most important was the Northern Army. It consisted of five regiments: the Archers, the Foot soldiers, the Elite Cavalry, the Garrison Cavalry, and the Chang River Regiment. Later, the army also contained non-Chinese auxiliary troops. Each regiment contained around 1,000 professionally trained soldiers. There was also a Southern Army of similar size, however, it didn't last as long and was of lower importance.\n\nThe palace guards patrolled the capital's multiple palaces' gates, towers, and walls. They numbered around 2000 and were managed by the Minister of Guards, one of the nine ministers. The Minister of the Household commanded several guard squads as well. The two militarily most valuable were the “Rapid as Tigers” (which the Champion Spearman represents), and the “Feathered Forest”. Both were between 1000 and 2000 men strong and responsible for the emperor's immediate personal security. Memberships in these units were passed on to the next generation.\n\nPrivate areas were guarded by eunuchs, castrated men serving in imperial palaces. Who were, on paper, under the command of the Minister Steward.\n\n  "
