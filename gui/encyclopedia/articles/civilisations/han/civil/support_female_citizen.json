    "Content":"Women during the Han period, per the teaching of Confucius, were supposed to serve their husbands with humility. That, however, did not mean that the women were powerless. There were many stories written praising wives who gave sage advice to their husbands, or warnings of scheming women who caused the destruction of entire households.\n\nWhile they did have a degree of freedom, the Han dynasty was in no way perfect in this regard. Like many places in ancient times, in Han China women could not own land (and consequentially didn’t have to pay taxes). And women were expected to stay in either of the household of their father or their husband. Even worse, it wasn’t unheard of for a wealthy Han man to take a second wife or concubine, which often caused fierce jealousy."
