    "Content":"Athens had a strong naval tradition. Seafaring was a big part of the Athenian culture. Athens' navy rose to power under the leadership of Themistocles. Following the Greek victory over Persian invaders at the Battle of Salamis in 480 BC, Athens dominated the Aegean Sea and controlled large territories in Ancient Greece. The navy was considered to be the largest and most powerful at the time. Athenian warships were well-designed and well-built, and crews consisted of professional rowers. These rowers, recruited from the lower classes,  were well-trained and experienced. At best, Athens could deploy a massive fleet of more than 400 triremes. Athens also invested heavily in securing trade routes. As a result, they enjoyed a period of prosperity, economic growth, and the flourishing of not only Athenian but also Greek civilization and culture. This period during the 5th century BC is known as the Golden Age of Athens. \n\nHowever, Athensâ€™ naval supremacy was challenged and eventually ended by Sparta in the Peloponnesian War. After this war, Athens never regained its former naval glory and influence.\n\n  "
