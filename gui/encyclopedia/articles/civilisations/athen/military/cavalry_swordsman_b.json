    "Content":"The second-highest social class in Ancient Athens was the hippeis, the cavalrymen. They formed a corps of about 1000 heavy cavalry troops, similar to cavalry units in other Greek city states. Even though these citizen soldiers received some equipment money from the state, they had to pay for all their horses, grooms, and equipment themselves, which often proved to be very expensive.\n\nTheir armor consisted of an iron helmet, a coat of mail, a kilt fringed with metal flaps, cuisses, and leather leggings. They wielded a straight, double-edged sword and a spear that could be thrown like a javelin or used as a lance in close-range combat. Horses had no horseshoes, bridles, stirrups, or saddlesâ€”just a piece of cloth draped over their backs.\n\nCavalry units in Ancient Greece posed a comparably insignificant factor in most battles, they generally avoided direct engagement with the enemy's line. Instead, they served as a mobile and versatile support force; skirmishing, scouting, or pursuing fleeing enemies. \n\n  "
