    "Content":"The Spartans specialized in melee infantry combat. The soldiers had to buy their own equipment, and most could not afford horses. Because of that, the Spartans used hardly any cavalry of their own in battles. They heavily relied on their Greek allies to provide cavalrymen for their armies. Without allied or mercenary units, cavalry was always a big weakness in the Spartan army.\n\nThe typical Greek cavalryman who would fight for Sparta carried a spear that could be thrown like a javelin or used as a lance in close-range combat, as well as maybe a sword. Some wore different pieces of body armor. Their horses had no horseshoes, bridles, stirrups, or saddlesâ€”just a piece of cloth draped over their backs.\n\n  "
