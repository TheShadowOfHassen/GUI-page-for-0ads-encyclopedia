    "Content":"The Palace of Pella was the home to the Macedonian kings, a sprawling complex covering an area of over 90,000 square yards (75,000 square meters). It was constructed by Phillip II and was Alexander the Greatâ€™s birthplace. Alexander expanded the palace, as did other Macedonian rulers after him. The city of Pella and the palace grew as a prominent location during the Hellenistic age. Sadly, the palace was destroyed in 168 BC after Macedonia was defeated by the Roman Empire.\n\n  "
