    "content": "The DierÄ“s (Greek bireme) was a type of ancient ship that had two rows of oars on each side, with one rower per oar. It was developed around the 7th century BC, probably by the Phonecians, and adapted by the Greeks.\n\nIt was an evolution of the earlier penteconter, which had only one row of oars on each side. Biremes were the first ships to implement the idea of stacking rows of oars to add more rowers without having to increase the length.\n\nThe bireme was probably similar in size to the penteconter and slightly smaller than the later trireme, with a length of about 100 feet (30.48 meters) and a width of about 10 feet (3.05 meters).\n\nDue to its higher rowing power, the bireme was faster and more maneuverable than any previous ship. Unlike its predecessors, triaconters and penteconters, which were only used for trading and troop transport, biremes were the first ships to be used in direct combat against other ships.\n\nEventually, biremes evolved into triremes, which had even more oars and were even faster. But still, they continued to be used in some fleets as an addition to heavier polyremes.",
