    "content":"The Lighthouse of Alexandria was located on a small island called Pharos, just off the coast of Alexandria. Construction was commissioned by Ptolemy I Soter, the founder of the Ptolemaic kingdom, and lasted multiple decades, costing 800 talents (equivalent to some tens of millions of modern-day US dollars) in total.\n\nThe building itself had a 90-by-90-foot (30-meter) base and was divided into three parts. The bottom block was square-the middle block octagonal- and the top part circularly shaped. Including an alleged statue at the top, the lighthouse was said to measure over 300 feet (100 meters) in height, making it the second-tallest man-made structure at the timeâ€”only behind the Pyramids of Giza.\n\nNot only in terms of size but also architecture and engineering, the lighthouse marked an impressive achievement, and it became a famed landmark for the metropolis of Alexandria. It is not without reason counted towards the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.\n\nAnd the structure proved resilient, the lighthouse survived over 1600 years before, damaged by multiple earthquakes, it either collapsed or was demolished."
