    "content":"Egypt during the Ptolemaic empire had a direct contrast between the upper-class Hellenistic women and the lower-class native Egyptians. The Greek upper class were held to the standard Hellenistic, which was an improvement compared to the Classical Greeks, a woman of Greek decent would not have as many legal privileges as her Egyptian counterpart.\n\n\tThat said there were still plenty of opportunities for even a Greek woman. Most famous perhaps would be Cleopatra IV, the last ruler of the Ptolemies who was popular with both her Greek and Egyptian subjects."
