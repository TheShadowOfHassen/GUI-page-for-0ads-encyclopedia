    "content": "The Nine Ministers formed the third governmental level in the Han dynasty, below the Three Excellencies and, of course, the emperor himself. They each led an office with subordinate functionaries and were responsible for a specific task:\n\nThe Minister of Ceremonies handled matters related to religion, organized official ceremonies, and functioned as the head of the Imperial Academy. The Minister of Household supervised a special group called the gentleman-attendants who worked for the imperial family. Gentleman-attendants either came from influential families, or were especially meritorious people, who, for example, were recommended by high officials. The Minster of Guards took care of security at imperial palaces by commanding the guards. The Minister Coachman was in charge of the Han army's horses, which were of high importance in the wars against the Xiognu, as well as the Emperor's personal horses, chariots, and carriages. The Minister of Justice made up the highest grade of jurisprudence (apart from the emperor), deciding high-level court cases. The Minister Herald was responsible for diplomacy and the empire's foreign affairs. The Minister of Imperial Clan coordinated the imperial Liu family and its many relatives; for example, he took care of the registration of new members. The Minister of Finance managed the empire's treasury and finances in general (for example, setting and collecting taxes) and was also responsible for the empire's agriculture. And finally, the Minister Steward was responsible for the imperial family's treasury.",
