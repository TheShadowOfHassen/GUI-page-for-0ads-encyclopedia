    "content":"In the first century BC, the Han empire defeated the Xiognu, a nomadic people inhabiting the lands north, and secured the Hexi Corridor. This corridor was a long, narrow passage through otherwise ungracious and hostile terrain, and through it, the Han had a safe connection to the West. It wasn't long before Han merchants started venturing into the unknown, establishing a vast trade networks as they went. This trade network, over a staggering 4000 miles (6400 kilometers) long, is today called the Silk Road. It led from the Han Empire through Middle Asia to India and all the way to Europe, and to another powerful empire around the Mediterranean. An empire, that, in size, even rivaled the Han's, The Roman Empire.\n\nOf course there is a reason it is called the Silk Road: although merchants traded with a variety of products, from foods to livestock, to jewelry, one was especially sought after, silk. Silk was exclusively produced in China and so was worth many times its weight in gold. It was sold in all corners of the world, even in the far away Roman Empire.\n\n\n\nBut not only goods were exchanged; traders transmitted their beliefs, customs, and knowledge to the people they encountered. The Silk Road is the first example of globalization in human history."
