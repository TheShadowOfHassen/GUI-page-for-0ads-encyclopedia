    "content":"Many religions were practiced throughout the Han dynasty, from the varied and diverse folk religions of the citizens to more structured religions such as Taoism and Buddhism, which appeared during the later part of the dynasty. However, the state-sanctioned religion was Confucianism, instituted by the first Han emperor, Gaozu.\n\nTraditional Confucianism was an attempt to return to an older, more ideal society. However, it soon became an entire word view, with scientific beliefs as well as a philosophy focused on learning, structure, and harmony.  And it worked. At least for a certain time. Especially during the early days, the Han Empire was a place of peace (at least within the Empire's borders) and in it Chinese culture flourished. It wasn’t without reason that this period was called “The Golden Age of China”."
