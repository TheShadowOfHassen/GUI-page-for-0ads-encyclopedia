    "content":"The Seleucid Empire was a monarchy and ruled a king with the Greek title of “Basileus”. He was not only an absolute ruler but also a self-proclaimed god. Besides, many kings were also military commanders, leading campaigns against external or internal enemies.\n\nThe Seleucids largely adopted the administrative structure of the predeceasing Achaemenid (Persian) kingdom. Many officials and nobles were allowed to keep their positions. The geographical division was left unchanged too. Their territory remained divided into around 20 satrapies, each governed by a satrap personally appointed by the king. The satraps, mostly Greeks, ran their satrapies fully themselves, but were subordinate to the laws and regulations of the centralized royal government. Each satrapy was subdivided further into smaller eparchies run by an eparch, those into even smaller political units, and so on. Maintaining strong royal authority across the vast territory, at peak stretching from Thrace in the West to the Indus River in the East, still turned out to be almost impossible. Many cities and regions became self-governed and gained high levels of autonomy."
