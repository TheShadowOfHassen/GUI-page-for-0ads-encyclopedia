    "content":"The Seleucid empire was home to many peoples with a profound tradition of horsemanship, like the Bactrians, Parthians, Armenians, Cappadocians, and Medians. But large parts of the Seleucid army's cavalry fought in a mixture of Macedonian and Persian combat styles.\n\nThe royal guard was adopted from the Macedonian army, and it included two prestigious cavalry forces: the Hetairoi (companion cavalry), probably composed of Greek settlers, and the Agema, of soldiers of a more eastern origin. Both forces were 1000 men strong and  were on constant duty stationed at the military base of Apamea. They wore  heavy armor and fought as lancers. \n\nA large section of the remaining Seleucid cavalry consisted of cleruchs, Greek settlers obliged to military service. They were part of the Seleucid society's upper class and considerably wealthy (so they could afford to buy and maintain horses).\n\nHowever, the Seleucids also fielded countless horsemen from all over their empire, equipped and fighting according to local customs. And allies, or mercenaries of various cultures and ethnicities, also stood in the Seleucid ranks. The Dahae tribes from the shores of the Caspian Sea, for example, are known for their light-ranged cavalry. Ancient Iranian cataphracts, a type of especially heavy cavalry, were also deployed. But there were a number more, for example, the Elymaians, Mysians, Galatians, and Tarentines."
