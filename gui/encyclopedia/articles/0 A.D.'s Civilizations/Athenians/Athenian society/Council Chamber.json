    "content": "The Prytaneion was the official residence of the city's or city-state's executives in Ancient Greece. It was usually located in the city's center, near or at the Agora, the public marketplace and forum. Because Prytaneia were constructed a bit differently in each city, today it can be difficult to identify them. However, their uses were the same. The Prytaneion was essentially the town hall, in which not only official political but also religious ceremonies and celebrations were held.\n\nInside the Prytaneion, there was the city's sacred fire of Hestia, the Greek goddess of hearth. This fire symbolized the unity and vitality of the city-state and its people, and was to incessantly be kept alight. Whenever a new colony was established, it was brought there to ignite the sacred fire of the newly founded community to assure longevity and prosperity.",
