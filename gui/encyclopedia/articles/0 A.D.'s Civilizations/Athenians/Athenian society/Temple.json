    "content": "Athens was extremely religious. The city state itself was named in honor  of Athena after she, as the Greek myth says, created the olive tree for them. She was their primary deity. That said, Athens worshiped all gods of the Greek pantheon and many besides.\n\nPerhaps one of the most amusing stories of Athenian was at the Battle of Marathon, where Athens, facing superior odds, vowed to sacrifice a she-goat to Artemis for every Persian they slew. They killed 6,400 Persians. They did not have that many she-goats on hand, so decided that they would sacrifice 500 goats per year, and did so for nearly a century.",
