    "content": "In Athens, only 18- to 20-year-olds were obligated to actively take part in military training. However, should war break out, men up to the age of 60 could be called up to serve in the Athenian army. This meant Athens' hoplite force largely consisted of militias who lacked training and experience.\n\nHowever, just as several other Greek city-states did, Athens maintained a small elite hoplite force of professional soldiers. They were called “Epilektoi” or “Logades” (both meaning “the chosen ones”). As the name implies, they were hand-picked for specific purposes. They could either be used to support the main hoplite body or carry out separate missions that required fighting expertise. The “Epilektoi” actually numbered only several hundred up to a thousand men and actually made up only a small percentage of Athens' large hoplite force which was, at their peak, more than 30,000 men strong.\n\nThey were probably recruited from a bracket of wealthy Athenian citizens, as every soldier had to provide his own equipment which not only consisted of a spear, a large round shield, a short sword, which were quite expensive for the average citizen, but also heavier (and more expensive) armor than regular hopilites that provided better protection.",
