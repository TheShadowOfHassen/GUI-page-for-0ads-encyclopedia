    "content": "Grapes were cultivated across many ancient civilizations and were eaten raw, dried as raisins, or, thanks to the yeast that grew naturally on the grape's skins, fermented into wine. Grapes were an important crop in a lot of civilizations, and vineyards were diligently tended. The soil around the grapes had to be aerated, and the vine branches had to be pruned so that more grapes could grow.",
