    "content":"Legends say that Pegasus sprung from the decapitated body of Medusa and was the mount for the Hero Bellerophon when the hero fought the Chimera. Afterwards Bellerophon became haughty and tried to fly Pegasus to Mount Olympus. Zeus, the king of the Greek gods, sent a fly to drive Pegasus wild. Bellerophon was thrown off and lived the rest of his life blind, lame, and in poverty. Nothing more was said about Pegasus, at least until now. The famous horse would fetch a fine price if sold."
