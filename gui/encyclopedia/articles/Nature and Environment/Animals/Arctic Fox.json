    "content": "In winter, the arctic fox’s white coat is one of the warmest furs of any animal on the planet. Come summer, their coats change to a gray-brown color. The Arctic fox’s length ranges from 20 to 30 inches (50 to 70 centimeters), not counting its tail.\n\nArctic foxes dig complex burrow systems for shelter and child-rearing, and they are shared by many mating pairs over several generations.",
