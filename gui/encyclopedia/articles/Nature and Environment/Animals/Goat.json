    "content":"The goat, like its relative, the sheep, was, in ancient times, an extremely useful animal. These animals provided meat, milk, and sometimes even wool. Goats can graze on not only grass but brush and twigs, allowing them to feast where a cow would starve. Goats are well adapted to mountainous areas, so they were quite useful to the people of Ancient Greece.\n\nNot only used for meat, goats were also used as sacrificial animals in civilizations such as the Greeks or Israelites."
