    "content": "The one-humped camel (Camelus dromedarius) is a unique animal well suited for hot, dry climates. They can get enough water to live from desert vegetation and can survive large drops in their bodyâ€™s water content. When there is water, the one-humped camel can drink an amount that would kill another animal of similar size. Camels store fat in a large hump on their back, and it helps them stay cool. Adult dromedaries can stand up to seven feet at their shoulders and weigh 1,500 pounds (680.39 kilograms).\n\nThe one-humped camel is, of course, related to the two-humped camel, which has two fat humps on its back instead of one. Camels are also related to Alpacas and Llamas.",
