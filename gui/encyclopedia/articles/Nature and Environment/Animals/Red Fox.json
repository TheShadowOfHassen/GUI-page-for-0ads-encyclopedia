    "content":"The red fox is an animal common everywhere thanks to its varied diet, which helps it survive in all different kinds of biomes. Its fur is usually reddish brown and its body length can get up to 35 inches (88.9 centimeters) long. On top of that, a red fox's tail can be anywhere from 11 to 19.5 inches longer (27 to 49 centimeters).\n\nRed foxes make their home in a den, be it a hole, cave, or the underside of some building, and a male (dog) and female (vixen) share the den and the surrounding territory. Although sometimes younger vixens live there and help raise the pairâ€™s children."
