    "content": "Wild donkeys, or asses, as they are often called, are the smallest species in the horse family. They can grow up to 5 feet (1.52 meters) tall, and have long ears, short legs, and a frame holding considerable power. While wild donkeys ranged anywhere from Africa to Asia, they were quickly domesticated and in ancient times used as a cheap but sturdy beast of burden.",
