    "content": "Aside from their obvious height, the giraffes' coat is the animal's most distinctive feature. While distinctive, however, every giraffeâ€™s coat is unique. Giraffes in modern day mostly range in Central Africa, but, in ancient times they lived further north.\n\nThis is an infantile giraffe. Newborn giraffes weigh close to 155 pounds (70.31 kilograms) and stand 6.5 feet (1.98 meters) tall. The mother takes care of the child for 13 months before he is weaned.",
