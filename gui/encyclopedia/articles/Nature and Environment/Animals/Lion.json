    "content":"The lion is the only species of cat with a complex social group. In fact, lions have not only one but two such groups. The first one is rather well known, and that is the pride. A pride contains anywhere from four to ten female lions along with their children. The females work together on both hunting and cub-raising. Sometimes the lionesses will nurse each other's cubs.\n\nThe second social group is composed of the males and is less frequent because sometimes the male lion prefers to live alone. This group is called a collation. Both collations and solitary males lay stake to a territory and all the prides inside it.\n\nMale lions are larger than their female counterparts, averaging 400 pounds (181 kilograms) instead of the lioness's 330 pounds (149 kilograms).\n\nLions were prevalent in ancient times, however, they became less prevalent due to the many of them that were captured to be killed in the Roman Coliseum."
