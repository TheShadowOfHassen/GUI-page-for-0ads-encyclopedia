    "content":"Sheep, in ancient times, were some of the most useful animals. They can live just as well on hills and mountains as on plains and survive cold as well as heat, and most civilizations from the Egyptians to the Britons kept them. Not only raised for their wool, sheep were kept also for their meat and even their milk. Also, the animal was used as a sacrifice in many religions, from Greece to Egypt to Ancient Israel.\n\nThere are many breeds of sheep in Ovis aries, with ranging sizes and shapes. One fact that stayed the same, however, was that while sheep were extremely useful, they werenâ€™t too bright and were vulnerable to attack. Shepherds watched over the flock, caring for them, protecting them from predators, and leading them to fresh grazing grounds."
