    "content":"The walrus dwells amid the ice floes in the Arctic Ocean. Both males and females have tusks, which they use to pull themselves out of the water or to anchor themselves to an ice floe, so they can sleep while still in the water. Males also use the tusks to spar for mates.\n\nThe walrus eats mostly seabed-dwelling animals, and to get them, it can dive over 330 feet (100.58 meters) and stay under for over 25 minutes.\n\nWalruses live in large herds, which can sometimes be as large as thousands of walruses."
