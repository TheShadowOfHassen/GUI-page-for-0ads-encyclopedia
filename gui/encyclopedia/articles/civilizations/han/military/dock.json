    "content": "While the Han dynasty is viewed as primarily a land empire, especially in the East and South, they kept a presence at sea as well. Han merchants sailed along the Maritime Silk Road, trading along the southern and eastern coasts of Asia.\n\nAnd the Han dynasty is thought to be the first in China's history to develop a capable navy. Their fleet mainly consisted of tower ships numbering 2,000 and employing 200,000 seamen. These fleets, however, were not suited for the high seas and operated along the coast or up rivers. However, the navy still proved to be useful. It was the Han's powerful fleet, for example, that secured the victory time and time again against the southern Minyue State.\n\nAlthough maritime activities were generally still of comparably low priority for the Han, they made important technical advancements such as inventing the stern rudder and building the first war junks, which laid the foundation for the dynasties to come.",
