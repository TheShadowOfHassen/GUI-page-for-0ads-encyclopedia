    "title": "Greek Cavalry",
    "content": "The second-highest social class in Ancient Athens was the “hippeis”, the cavalrymen. They formed a corps of about 1000 heavy cavalry troops, similar to cavalry units in other Greek city states. Even though these citizen soldiers received some equipment money from the state, they had to cover most of the incurring expenses - from horses, to grooms, to their own equipment - by themselves, which could get very expensive.\n\nTheir armor was pretty ordinary for a Greek cavalry; it usually consisted of an iron helmet, a coat of mail, a kilt fringed with metal flaps, cuisses, and leather leggings. They wielded a straight, double-edged sword and a spear that could be thrown like a javelin or used as a lance in close-range combat. Horses had no horseshoes, bridles, stirrups, or saddles—just a piece of cloth draped over their backs.\n\nAlthough they enjoyed elite status in the Athenian army, the cavalry posed a comparably insignificant factor in most battles, they generally avoided direct engagement with the enemy's line. Instead, they served as a mobile and versatile support force; skirmishing, scouting, or pursuing fleeing enemies.",
