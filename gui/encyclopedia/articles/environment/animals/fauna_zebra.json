    "Content":"The common zebra, or plains zebra, as it is sometimes called, is a very distinctive animal with its unique striped coat. In fact, a zebraâ€™s coat is so unique that no two zebras have the same stripes. They can stand up to 5 feet (1.52 meters) high and weigh up to 100 pounds (45.36 kilograms). Herds of the common zebra live across the plains of northern Africa, where they often graze side by side with other peaceful animals.\n\n  "
