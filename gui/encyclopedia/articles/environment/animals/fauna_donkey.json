    "Content":"Wild donkeys, or asses, as they are often called, are the smallest species in the horse family. They can grow up to 5 feet (1.52 meters) tall, with long ears, short legs, and a frame of considerable power. While wild donkeys ranged anywhere from Africa to Asia, they were quickly and in ancient times used as a cheap but sturdy beast of burden.\n\n  "
