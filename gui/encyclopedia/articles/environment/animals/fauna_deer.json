    "Content":"The Western Red Deer ranges all over Europe and into Asia and North Africa. Their name comes from the reddish-brown coat that they wear in summer. In winter, their coat fades to a dull brown. The female deer (hinds) live in herds, while the stags live apart except during the fall rut.\n\nLike most species of deer, only the males grow antlers. And these have a cycle of falling off each winter and regrowing over the spring and summer, so they can be used in the fall to battle other stags during the rut.\n\n  "
