    "Content":"Both Polyaenus and Aelian write that in 266 BC, when Megara was under siege. The locals dumped pitch, tar or some other flammable liquid on pigs, set them alight, and sent them toward the enemy elephants. The elephants, hearing the squeals and seeing the flames, panicked, killing many of the besiegers and lifting the siege. Afterwards, the Romans were said to adopt this strategy to counter elephants.\n\n  "
