    "Content":"“Dragonflies, katydids, but mostly chewed-up little kids”-- Hobbes on what Tigers are made out of: Calvin and Hobbes.\n\n\n\n\n\nTigers are the largest species of cat, reaching 9.5 feet (2.89 meter) long. In ancient times, their range could have reached through Asia up to modern-day Turkey. However, in the modern day, they are only found in small patches in southeast Asia. The tiger, however, could easily survive anywhere there is dense cover, water and large enough prey to sustain it.\n\nTigers hunt at night. Usually it takes deer and wild pigs, but thanks to its size can attack small rhinoceroses and elephants. It would not have any problem taking out cattle or even an unprepared man.\n\nUnlike many other cats, tigers enjoy the water and have been seen swimming and even hunting in it. \n\n  "
