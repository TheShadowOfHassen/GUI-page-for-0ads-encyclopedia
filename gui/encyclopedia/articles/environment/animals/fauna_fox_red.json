    "Content":"The red fox is a widespread species thanks to their varied diet, which helps them survive in all different kinds of biomes. Their fur (obviously) is usually a reddish brown. Their body length can get up to 35 inches (88.9 centimeters) long, but their tail can be anywhere from 11 to 19.5 inches longer (27 to 49 centimeters).\n\nRed foxes make their home in a den, be it a hole, cave, or the underside of some building, and a male (dog) and female (vixen) share the den and the surrounding territory. Although, sometimes younger vixens live there also and help raise the pairâ€™s children.\n\n  "
