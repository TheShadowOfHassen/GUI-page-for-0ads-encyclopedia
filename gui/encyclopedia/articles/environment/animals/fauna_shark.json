    "Content":"The Great White Shark (sometimes also known as the White Pointer or just the White Shark) is probably the most fearsome predator in the oceans. Its length ranges from 20 to 28 feet (6.09 to 8.53 meters), and it can weigh up to 2.25 tons (2.04 metric tons). Its skin is gray, and it has a white underbelly. Its powerful body allows it to chase down its prey and devour them with its many rows of jagged teeth. Teeth that come in row by row throughout its entire life.\n\nWhile it has the reputation of being a man-eater, the Great White Shark’s primary diet are creatures like seals, dolphins, and large fish. However, one wouldn’t hesitate to try something else.\n\n  "
