    "content": "Humans have for a long time kept elephants; the earliest evidence dates back to the year 2000 BC. However, unlike other animals, they were not domesticated because breeding  proved nearly impossible due to their enormous size, complex social behavior, and long gestation. Instead, most elephants were captured from the wild.\n\nThey were tamed by special elephant keepers called mahouts, often of Indian origin. Mahouts spent their lives forming a close relationship with their elephant, learning to ride it and guiding it to perform certain labor tasks, such as carrying luggage. Depending on the circumstances, mahouts also trained them as war elephants and led them into battle.",
