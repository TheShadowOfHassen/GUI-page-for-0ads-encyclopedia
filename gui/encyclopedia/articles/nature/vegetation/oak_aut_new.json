    "content": "The species Oak (Quercus) is one of the most recognizable trees on earth. There are many varieties of the tree from the more standard English Oak to the Holm Oak, which is an evergreen. While leaves, heights, and widths vary, one thing stays the same: the acorn. While an acorn’s size and shape may vary from tree to tree, in every form, it is the oak’s most recognizable feature.\n\nIt is autumn now and this oak's leaves are turning colors and begining to fall. Clearly, it isn't a Holm Oak.",
