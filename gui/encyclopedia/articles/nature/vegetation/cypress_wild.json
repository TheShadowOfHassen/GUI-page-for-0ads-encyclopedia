    "content": "The Italian Cypress (Cupressus sempervirens) is a unique tree that can keep a tight, columnar shape. Despite its name, the tree ranges along the entire northern coast of the Mediterranean. It has gray bark and grows larger than most cypresses, growing up to 60 feet (18.29 meters). Unlike other cypresses, its needles have no noticeable scent when crushed.\n\nThis cypress has grown wild.",
