    "content": "The Banyan Tree or Ficus benghalensis is a unique fig tree. They start as a small epiphyte that grows on a host tree before suffocating and taking its place. The tree has huge, low-spreading branches that often grow down to become secondary trunks. Over time, the Banyan can grow to massive sizes. Most Banyans grow around 100 feet (30.48 meters) tall, but their canopy can cover an area of 1,000 feet (30.48 meters).",
