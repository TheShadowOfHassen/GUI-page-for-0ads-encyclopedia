    "content": "The White Rhinoceroses are one of the largest land animals, growing 14 feet (4.27 meters) long and weighing up to 4 tons (3.62 metric tons). They are stolid animals with thick, leathery skin that, with its folds, appears to be not skin but a suit of plate armor! The white Rhino has two large horns on its head, which it uses to defend itself.\n\nRhinoceroses are usually solitary except during mating and the relationship between mother and child. The White Rhino has a sixteen-month gestation period. Afterward, the mother can form small herds with up to seven of her juvenile children.",
